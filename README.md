# TriviaGame

This is a custom version of Kahoot, written from scratch with vanilla Javascript.
<br/>
This project uses a lot of technologies : <br/>
* FastAPI
* WebSockets and Python sockets
* HTML, CSS and JS
* Python Bluetooth
<br/>

The project could have been done using prebuilt technologies, but I wanted to test what I can make using the most basic of tools.<br/>
Where user would launch all the scripts, then through a shell or phone connected with bluetooth could control the flow of the application,
whether to go to next question, show results, start timer...
